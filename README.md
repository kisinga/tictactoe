# tictactoe
This is a simple golang cross-platform desktop app using [fyne UI toolkit](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne).
Have fun playing Tic Tac Toe against the computer or a human friend.
I didnt know where to start so I took inspiration from [this js project](https://code-boxx.com/simple-javascript-tic-tac-toe)
Created just for the fun of it.

Run as a regular go app

#How to run
Download the correct executable for your platform under
